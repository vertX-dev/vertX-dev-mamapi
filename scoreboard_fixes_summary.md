# Scoreboard Object Creation Issues - ITEM RARITY main.js

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical Logic Bug in `parseLoreToStats` Function
**Problem**: The condition on line 189 was `arraySize != 0`, which caused the function to return an empty array whenever there was actual lore content to parse.

**Original Code**:
```javascript
if (!arraySize || arraySize != 0 || !loreArray) return [];
```

**Fixed Code**:
```javascript
if (!arraySize || arraySize === 0 || !loreArray) return [];
```

**Impact**: This bug prevented any item attributes from being parsed from lore, meaning scoreboard objects were never being created with actual stat values.

### 2. Missing Loop Increment
**Problem**: The while loop in `parseLoreToStats` wasn't incrementing `ix` when the "§8Attributes" marker wasn't found, potentially causing infinite loops.

**Fix**: Added `ix++` at the end of the main while loop to ensure proper iteration.

### 3. Minecraft Scoreboard Naming Restrictions
**Problem**: Scoreboard objective names in Minecraft have strict limitations:
- Must be lowercase
- Only alphanumeric characters allowed
- Maximum 16 characters length
- Some tracker names like "critChance", "knockbackRes", "attackSpeed" violate these rules

**Original scoreboard tracker names that would cause issues**:
- `critChance` → `critchance`
- `critDamage` → `critdamage`
- `attackSpeed` → `attackspeed`
- `miningSpeed` → `miningspeed`
- `knockbackRes` → `knockbackres`
- `magicFind` → `magicfind`
- `flightSpeed` → `flightspeed`

**Solution**: 
- Created `sanitizeScoreboardName()` helper function
- Automatically converts to lowercase
- Removes non-alphanumeric characters
- Truncates to 15 characters (leaving room for safety)

### 4. Inconsistent Scoreboard Name Usage
**Problem**: The `loadScoreboards()` function was creating objectives with one naming scheme, but `compileBuffs()` was trying to access them with different names.

**Fix**: Both functions now use the same `sanitizeScoreboardName()` function to ensure consistency.

## Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error logging in `loadScoreboards()`
- Improved console messages to show both original and sanitized names
- More descriptive error messages for debugging

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with items that have multiple attributes
2. Verify scoreboard objectives are created successfully
3. Check that player scores are updated correctly
4. Monitor console for any remaining errors

## Before/After Scoreboard Names
| Original | Sanitized |
|----------|-----------|
| damage | damage |
| health | health |
| critChance | critchance |
| critDamage | critdamage |
| attackSpeed | attackspeed |
| miningSpeed | miningspeed |
| knockbackRes | knockbackres |
| fireRes | fireres |
| flightSpeed | flightspeed |
| magicFind | magicfind |

The fixes should resolve all scoreboard creation issues while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing stat system.
